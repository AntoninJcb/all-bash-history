# Bash History All

This set of files collects and retains bash history across sessions, including those coming into the machine via SSH.

They are written by Leeland Artra in article http://nodsw.com/blog/leeland/2012/03/07-all-bash-history-revisited-load-time-solved-plus-directory-history.

There are three files:
    .bashrc.user
    a_loghistory_func.sh
    acd_func.sh

For my machine, I appended the contents of .bashrc.user to ~/.bashrc, placed the other two files in ~/bin/ and made them exececutable.

Works like a charm.
